Are you searching for a software engineer with ability to develop high-performance applications and technical innovations? If so, please consider my enclosed resume.

Previously I have served as a software engineer for Infosys, where I have been involved in developing innovative solutions for multimillion-dollar, globally deployed software and systems. I am responsible for full lifecycle development of next-generation software, from initial requirement gathering to design, coding, testing, documentation and implementation. 

My technical expertise includes cross-platform proficiency (Windows, Linux); fluency in scripting/programming languages (including Java, Python, R and SQL); and good knowledge of Big Data Stack (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, MapReduce, YARN), developer applications, tools, methodologies and best practices.
